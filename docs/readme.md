# Wizard's power


## Introduction
We are two students from CITM Terrassa, in second grade of game design. This project has been done for the subject of videogame development. Since we started the subject we have been applying what we were learning in class in this project.So here you can see our final result.
In the game you will take on the role of a magician who will have to get stronger knowing new spells, thanks to the magic books that are around the town. But it will not be so easy to get them because the town is full of enemies and a final boss waiting at the end of town.
Good luck!

## Evolution
We started the project learning how to use Tiled an pugi, thanks to this we could do a simple platformer game loading from Tiled the map and the option to save and load the position of the player.
Later we learned pathfinding, starting from BFS, dijkstra and finally A*. After that we started to control the framerate in the game, capping the FPS or using dt. Once we implemented that in the game we started to use Brofiler, a tool that can help us to know how efficent is our code.
And finally we implemented the user interface and HUD in the game.
Out of the core requirements we implemented a module that controls all the abilities, a mana system and  an in game menu.
